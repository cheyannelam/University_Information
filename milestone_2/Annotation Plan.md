### Annotation Plan

---

#### Type of Annotation

We will undertake a detailed annotation project focused on universities, which includes several key dimensions:

- **City Size (Population):** Annotators will classify the location of universities into large, middle, or small cities based on population size.
- **Type of Institution:** Identification of whether the institution is public or private.
- **Year of Institution's History:** Determination of the institution's history as being long or short.
- **City Economy - GDP:** Evaluation of the city's economy, annotating it as high, middle, or low based on GDP.
- **Country Development Level:** Categorization of the country's development level as developed or developing.

#### Annotation Method

The entire annotation process will be conducted manually without the use of any automated annotation tools. Our team will rely on publicly available data and direct information from university and city websites to make informed decisions on each annotation category.

#### Annotators

Our annotation team will consist of four members, all of whom possess the necessary domain knowledge and linguistic expertise for this task. To ensure the reliability of our annotations, at least 20% of the data will be cross-annotated to calculate inter-annotator agreement.

#### Data and Expectations

We aim to annotate 1000 university entries. Each team member will annotate 300 entries, with around 200 entries cross-annotated for inter-annotator agreement (IAA) calculations. This strategy is designed to optimize our resources while ensuring high-quality and consistent annotations.

#### Quality Assurance Steps

To maintain the highest quality of our annotations, we will implement the following steps:

- **Training Session:** A detailed training session for all annotators will be conducted to clarify the guidelines and ensure a common understanding of the task requirements.
- **Pilot Study:** A pilot study with a small subset of the data will be performed to identify any potential ambiguities or issues within our annotation schema. This will also allow us to refine our guidelines before proceeding with the annotation of the full dataset.

By taking these steps, we commit to upholding stringent standards for our data annotation project, aiming to generate valuable insights into the characteristics of universities worldwide.
