    "Inha University": "Inha University (Korean: 인하대학교; Hanja: 仁荷大學校) is a private research university located in Incheon, South Korea.\nKnown traditionally for research and education in the engineering and physical sciences, the university was established by the first president of South Korea, Syngman Rhee. Inha is a Korean-American collaboration school, even in its name: the Morpheme \"In\" (인, 仁) comes from the city of Incheon and \"Ha\" (하, 荷) from Hawaii, USA. Started as a polytechnic university in 1954, named Inha Institute of Technology (Acronym: IIT; Korean, 인하공과대학, Inha Gonggwa Daehak, colloquially Inhagongdae), the institute has been achieving national recognition and a strong reputation as a technological research university thereafter."
