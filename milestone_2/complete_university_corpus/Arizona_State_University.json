    "Arizona State University": "Arizona State University (Arizona State or ASU) is a public research university[10] in the Phoenix metropolitan area.[11] Founded in 1885 as Territorial Normal School by the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature, ASU is now one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the United States.[12] It was one of about 180 \"normal schools\" founded in the  late 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools.  Some closed, but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century, then state universities in the late 20th century. [13]"
