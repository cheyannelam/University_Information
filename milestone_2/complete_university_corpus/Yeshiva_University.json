    "Yeshiva University": "Yeshiva University is a private Orthodox Jewish university with four campuses in New York City.[4] The university's undergraduate schools—Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, Katz School of Science and Health, and Sy Syms School of Business—offer a dual curriculum inspired by Modern–Centrist–Orthodox Judaism's hashkafa (philosophy) of Torah Umadda (\"Torah and secular knowledge\"), combining academic education with the study of the Torah.[5] While the majority of students at the university identify as Modern Orthodox,[6] many students, especially at the Cardozo School of Law, the Sy Syms School of Business, and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, are not Jewish."
