    "University of Bristol": "The University of Bristol is a red brick Russell Group research university in Bristol, England.[8] It received its royal charter in 1909,[9] although it can trace its roots to a Merchant Venturers' school founded in 1595 and University College, Bristol, which had been in existence since 1876.[10]"
