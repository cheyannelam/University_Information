    "The University of Sydney": "The University of Sydney (USYD), also known as Sydney University,[18] or informally Sydney Uni, is a public research university located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1850, it is the oldest university in both Australia and Oceania.[19] One of Australia's six sandstone universities, it was one of the first universities in the world to admit students solely on academic merit, and opened their doors to women on the same basis as men.[20] The university comprises eight academic faculties and university schools, through which it offers bachelor, master and doctoral degrees."
