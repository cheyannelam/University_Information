    "Freie Universitaet Berlin": "The Free University of Berlin[a] (German: Freie Universit√§t Berlin, often abbreviated as FU Berlin or simply FU) is a public research university in Berlin. It was founded in West Berlin in 1948 with American support during the early Cold War period as a Western continuation of the Friedrich Wilhelm University, or the University of Berlin,[3][4] whose traditions and faculty members it retained. The Friedrich Wilhelm University (which was renamed the Humboldt University), being in East Berlin, faced strong communist repression; the Free University's name referred to West Berlin's status as part of the Western Free World, contrasting with communist-controlled East Berlin."
