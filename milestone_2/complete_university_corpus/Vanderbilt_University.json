    "Vanderbilt University": "Vanderbilt University (informally Vandy or VU) is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1873, it was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment in the hopes that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the American Civil War.[11] Vanderbilt is a founding member of the Southeastern Conference and has been the conference's only private school since 1966.[12]"
