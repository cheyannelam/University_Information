    "Université du Québec": "The Université du Québec is a system of ten provincially-run public universities in Quebec, Canada.  Its headquarters are in Quebec City. The university coordinates 1400 programs for over 100,000 students.[1] The government of Quebec founded the Université du Québec, a network of universities in several Quebec cities. In a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces, all universities in Quebec have since become public."
