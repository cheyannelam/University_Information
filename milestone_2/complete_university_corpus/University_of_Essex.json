The university shield consists of the ancient arms attributed to the Kingdom of Essex and the motto: \"Thought the harder, heart the keener\" is adapted from the Anglo-Saxon poem The Battle of Maldon.[5] The university comprises three campuses in the county, in Southend-on-Sea and Loughton with its primary campus in Wivenhoe Park, Colchester."
