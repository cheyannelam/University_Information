    "Carleton University": "Carleton University is an English-language public research university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1942 as Carleton College, the institution originally operated as a private, non-denominational evening college to serve returning World War II veterans.[4] Carleton was chartered as a university by the provincial government in 1952 through The Carleton University Act, which was then amended in 1957, giving the institution its current name.[4] The university is named after the now-dissolved Carleton County, which included the city of Ottawa at the time the university was founded."
