    "University of Oslo": "The University of Oslo (Norwegian: Universitetet i Oslo; Latin: Universitas Osloensis) is a public research university located in Oslo, Norway. It is the oldest university in Norway and consistently considered the country's leading university and one of the highest ranked universities in the Nordic countries. Originally named the Royal Frederick University, the university was established in 1811 as the de facto Norwegian continuation of Denmark-Norway's common university, the University of Copenhagen, with which it shares many traditions. It was named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and received its current name in 1939. The university was commonly nicknamed \"The Royal Frederick's\" (Det Kgl. Frederiks) before the name change, and informally also referred to simply as Universitetet (lit.â€‰'the university')."
