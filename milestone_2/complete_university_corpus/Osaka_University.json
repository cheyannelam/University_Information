    "Osaka University": "Osaka University (大阪大学, Ōsaka daigaku), abbreviated as Handai (阪大), is a public research university in Osaka, Japan. The university traces its roots back to Edo-era institutions such as the Tekijuku (founded in 1838) and the Kaitokudo (1724), and was officially established in 1931 as the sixth of the Imperial Universities in Japan, with two faculties: science and medicine. Following the post-war educational reform, it merged with three pre-war higher schools, reorganizing as a comprehensive university with five faculties: science, medicine, letters, law and economics, and engineering.[6] After the merger with Osaka University of Foreign Studies in 2007, it became the largest national university in Japan by undergraduate enrollment."
