    "University of Pavia": "The University of Pavia (Italian: Università degli Studi di Pavia, UNIPV or Università di Pavia; Latin: Alma Ticinensis Universitas) is a university located in Pavia, Lombardy, Italy. There was evidence of teaching as early as 1361, making it one of the oldest universities in the world. It was the sole university in Milan and the greater Lombardy region until the end of the 19th century.[1]\nIn 2022 the university was recognized by the Times Higher Education among the top 10 in Italy and among the 300 best in the world.[2]\nCurrently, it has 18 departments and 9 faculties. It does not have a main campus; its buildings and facilities are scattered around the city, which is in turn called \"a city campus.\" The university caters to more than 20,000 students who come from Italy and all over the world."
