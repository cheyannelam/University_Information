    "University of Birmingham": "The University of Birmingham (informally Birmingham University)[8][9] is a public research university in Birmingham, England. It received its royal charter in 1900 as a successor to Queen's College, Birmingham (founded in 1825 as the Birmingham School of Medicine and Surgery), and Mason Science College (established in 1875 by Sir Josiah Mason), making it the first English civic or 'red brick' university to receive its own royal charter, and the first English unitary university.[2][10][11] It is a founding member of both the Russell Group of British research universities and the international network of research universities, Universitas 21."
