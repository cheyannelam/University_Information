    "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology": "Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) (Korean: 대구경북과학기술원) is a public science and engineering university located on Daegu Technopolis, Daegu, South Korea.[1] DGIST is one of the four public universities in South Korea dedicated to research in science and technology, along with KAIST, GIST, UST, and UNIST. Under the Special Act on Support of Scientists and Engineers for Strengthening National Science and Technology Competitiveness, the Korean government enacted the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology Act (Act No. 6996) and founded DGIST in 2004 as a research institute. In 2008, the act was amended to extend the role of the institute to both research and education, which eventually enabled a transition from research institute to university for DGIST."
