    "University of the Rosary": "University of the Rosary (in Spanish, Universidad del Rosario, and officially Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario) is a Colombian university founded on Roman Catholic principles, in 1653 by Fray Cristobal de Torres.  Located in Bogotá, due to its important place in Colombian history, it is known as \"the Cradle of the Republic\". Most faculties reside at the Cloister, the main campus located in the historic-geographical centre of Bogotá. It also included a private all-male traditional primary and secondary school until 2008."
