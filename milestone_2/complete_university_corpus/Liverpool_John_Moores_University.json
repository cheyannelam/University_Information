    "Liverpool John Moores University": "Liverpool John Moores University (abbreviated LJMU) is a public research university in the city of Liverpool, England. The university can trace its origins to the Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, established in 1823.[3] This later merged to become Liverpool Polytechnic. In 1992, following an Act of Parliament, the Liverpool Polytechnic became what is now Liverpool John Moores University.[4] It is named after Sir John Moores, a local businessman and philanthropist, who donated to the university's precursor institutions."
