    "Trinity College Dublin": "Trinity College (Irish: Coláiste na Tríonóide), officially The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin,[1] is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, a research university in Dublin, Ireland.[10] Queen Elizabeth I issued a royal charter for the college in 1592 as \"the mother of a university\" that was modelled after the collegiate universities of both Oxford and Cambridge,[11] but unlike these affiliated institutions, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \"Trinity College\" and \"University of Dublin\" are usually synonymous for administrative purposes.[12]"
