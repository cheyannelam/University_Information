    "# Web Interface Plan for Corpus Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to develop a web interface that provides interactive access to our corpus and annotations. Utilizing FastAPI for backend-frontend communication, our focus is on facilitating user engagement. The interface will feature two main components: a search functionality for the corpus and access to annotated data. Below is a detailed plan of our intentions and the rationale behind our choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The search feature is a cornerstone of our interface, designed to allow users to navigate and explore the corpus based on specific queries. This feature will consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Box:** For users to input their search terms.\n",
    "- **Search Button:** To execute the search based on the entered terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to leverage existing indexing engines, such as Elasticsearch or Whoosh, recognizing their capability to efficiently manage large datasets and deliver fast, accurate search results. This choice is driven by the need to provide a seamless and responsive user experience, facilitating immediate access to the corpus content relevant to the user's interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access to Annotated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to general corpus exploration, our interface will offer a unique feature to access annotated data. Recognizing that our annotations cover only a portion of the corpus, this functionality might operate somewhat independently from the primary search feature. It will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annotated Data Only Checkbox:** Allows users to filter their search results to include only documents that contain annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature aims to deepen user engagement by highlighting the insights and analysis our annotations provide. It serves as an essential tool, guiding users through nuanced understandings of the corpus content and showcasing the value of detailed annotation work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface Design and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Our design philosophy prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness to ensure that the interface is accessible to a broad audience, including those with varying degrees of technical proficiency. We intend to create an intuitive and streamlined user experience that encourages exploration and discovery within the corpus. This approach is underpinned by our goal to make the corpus and its annotations not only accessible but also a valuable resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to implement these specific functionalities reflects our commitment to enhancing the usability and educational potential of our corpus. By facilitating easy access to both the breadth of the corpus and the depth of our annotations, we aim to create an enriching platform that supports learning, research, and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Last Part\n",
    "Acknowledging that this plan sets the foundation for our project, we remain flexible to adjustments based on feedback, technical challenges, and evolving project insights. "
